== Exception Handling Best Practices 
1. Use Specific Exception Types: Avoid catching generic Exception whenever possible. Instead, anticipate potential errors and catch specific exceptions like TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, etc. This allows you to handle different error scenarios appropriately and provides more context for debugging.

2. Handle Exceptions Gracefully: When an exception is caught, provide helpful error messages that explain what went wrong and potentially how to fix it. Logging the error with relevant details (timestamp, function name, input values) is extremely beneficial for troubleshooting.

3. try...except...else...finally Blocks: Use the full power of these blocks for comprehensive error management.

try: Enclose the code that might raise an exception.
except: Catch specific exceptions and handle them. You can have multiple except blocks for different exception types.
else: Code within the else block executes only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. This is useful for code that should run only when the main operation is successful.
finally: Code in the finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This block is typically used for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.
4. Raise Exceptions When Appropriate: Don't be afraid to raise your own exceptions using the raise keyword when your code encounters an unexpected situation or invalid input. Create custom exception classes by inheriting from built-in exception types to signal specific error conditions in your application.

5. Use Context Managers (with statement): Context managers simplify resource management and ensure proper cleanup even in case of errors. Common examples include opening files or acquiring database connections. The with statement automatically handles closing or releasing the resource when the block exits, preventing resource leaks.

6. Avoid Silent Failures: Suppressing exceptions without handling them (e.g., using a bare except or ignoring exceptions entirely) can lead to hidden bugs and make debugging extremely difficult. Always handle exceptions or re-raise them if necessary.

7. Keep Error Handling Concise and Readable: Avoid overly complex error handling logic. Keep the try block focused on the core operation and the except blocks concise and clear. If error handling becomes too complicated, consider refactoring your code to simplify it.

8. Document Error Handling: Document the expected exceptions that a function might raise and how they are handled. This helps other developers understand the potential error scenarios and use your code correctly.
