Software Maintenance (SM) Fundamentals::

Fundamentals provide definitions, the nature and necessity of software maintenance, and the evolution of software, and categorizes software maintenance into corrective, preventive, adaptive, additive, and perfective maintenance. Each category has a specific focus, from fixing bugs to enhancing functionality and ensuring the software remains relevant in changing technological landscapes.

Key Issues in Software Maintenance::

Software maintenance poses several technical and management challenges. It is essential to comprehend the costs involved in software maintenance, technical debt, and the requirement for accurate cost estimation. Properly addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring software quality and manageability in the long term.

Software Maintenance Processes::

The maintenance processes involve multiple activities and tasks that are necessary for effective software maintenance. Such processes can also be integrated with other software engineering activities to demonstrate the interconnected nature of software development and maintenance.

Software Maintenance Techniques::

Techniques such as program comprehension, software reengineering, reverse engineering, and continuous integration delivery testing and deployment are essential. These techniques are essential for understanding existing software, adapting and improving it, and ensuring its continued operation and relevance.

Software Maintenance Tools::

SM tools facilitate tasks like configuration management, software testing, quality assessment, and reverse engineering. Effective use of these tools can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of software maintenance efforts.
