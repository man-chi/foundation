== typescript

* prefer interface than type alias; interface is open for extension, while type is close for nested type
* type aliases can be helpful when working with union types, intersection types, and generics,
* union type: `type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";`
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37233735/typescript-interfaces-vs-types/52682220#52682220

* The shape-matching only requires a subset of the objectâ€™s fields to match; There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes, as long as the arguement is compatible or subset!

[source,javascript]
----
const point3 = { x: 12, y: 26, z: 89 };
logPoint(point3); // logs "12, 26"

const rect = { x: 33, y: 3, width: 30, height: 80 };
logPoint(rect); // logs "33, 3"

const color = { hex: "#187ABF" };
logPoint(color);
Argument of type '{ hex: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Point'.
Type '{ hex: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Point': x, y
----

tuple(and) vs union (or) type::
* tuples are for fixed-size arrays with known types at each index, while union types are for expressing that a value can be of multiple types.

* since JS does not have emum, using union for such

union vs Intersections::

[source]
----
type Combined = { a: number } & { b: string };
type Conflicting = { a: number } & { a: string };
----

unknown (top type) vs any::
* When a value is of type unknown, you must perform a type check or type assertion before using it, whereas a value of type any can be assigned to and from any other type without type checking.

never (bottom type) vs void::
* never is used to represent the type of values that never occur.
It is typically used as the return type of functions that never return, such as functions that throw errors or have infinite loops.
* void is used to indicate that a function does not return a value.
It is the absence of a specific type, and is commonly used as the return type of functions that perform an action but do not produce a result.

* Avoid using symbols for public APIs or general-purpose replacements for strings
* `let age: number | undefined;` // Use undefined for uninitialized variables
* object: // Avoid using object type if a more specific type can be used

undefined vs null (judiciously)::
* Use undefined for uninitialized variables, function arguments that are omitted, or missing object properties.
* Use null to represent an intentional absence of value assigned by developers, or as a default value when no other value is available.


Boxed types::

[source]
----
(1).toExponential();
// equivalent to
Number.prototype.toExponential.call(1);
----

nullable and optional in TS::
Here's an example of using ? for optional properties in TypeScript:

----
// Optional property syntax in TypeScript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number; // Optional property
}
// nullable
let nullableString: string | null = "Hello";
----

prototype-based OO vs interface-based OO::
* prototype-based OO: class (js)
* interface-based OO: interface (ts/java)

== kotlin

* using seal class & arrow's either to achieve Union type like TS
