== Git Best Practices
:navtitle: git best practices

- branching strategy
- pull request
- conflict resolution
- commit message best practices

== create a New Module
* checkout antora template from https://github.com/man-chi/example-antora-basic[repo]
* in /main-project directory , create subdir for module e.g. `kt-module-basic`
* open gradle panel, add kt project

== Create a Feature Branch (gitflow):
From the main branch (or develop if you follow Gitflow), pull the latest changes: `git checkout main && git pull.`
Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature.`

== Develop Your Feature:
Make your changes in the feature branch.
Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages: git commit -m "Add a specific change detail".

== Keep Your Branch Updated:
Regularly rebase or merge updates from the main branch to keep your feature branch up to date and to minimize merge conflicts: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main.`

== Push Your Branch:
Push your feature branch to the remote repository: `git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature.`

== Create a Pull Request (PR):
Go to the repository on the hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and create a new pull request for your branch.
Clearly describe the changes and the purpose of the feature.
Link any relevant issues or documentation in the PR description.

== Code Review:
Request reviews from your teammates or maintainers.
Respond to comments and feedback.
Make any necessary changes and update the PR by pushing additional commits.

== Automated Checks:
Ensure that automated checks (like CI/CD pipelines, code linters, and tests) pass.
If checks fail, fix the issues and update the PR.

== PR Approval:
Once your PR is approved by the reviewers and all checks pass, it's ready to be merged.
If your repository requires it, make sure your branch has the required number of approvals.

== Merge the PR:
Before merging, ensure your branch is up to date with the base branch (usually main or develop).
Use the repository's interface to merge the PR, often with options like "Merge", "Squash and merge", or "Rebase and merge" depending on the project's merge policy.
Delete the feature branch from the remote repository after the merge, if the platform doesn't do it automatically.

== Post-Merge:
Pull the changes into your local main branch: git checkout main && git pull.
Delete the local feature branch if you no longer need it: `git branch -d feature/my-new-feature.``
